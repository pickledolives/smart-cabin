# Smart Cabin

See it live on Heroku: <http://smart-cabin.herokuapp.com>

A hackathon project done at [THack Hamburg 2015](https://www.tnooz.com/event/thack-hamburg-2015/) by Team XapiX represented by:

- [Raphael Gernot Klingmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enbarca/de)
- [Oliver Thamm](https://de.linkedin.com/in/othamm)

Our main goal was to learn about the sponsoring [IATA NDC](http://www.ndc-blog.iata.org/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=103) standard and network in the travel / transportation industry. Still, we found time to participate and use our main project [XapiX.io](http://www.xapix.io) as backend for Smart Cabin, an on-flight entertainment system distributed via WiFi.
